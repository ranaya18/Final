            <h5>Here's why Sags are GREAT...</h5>
            <p>Primary strength is optimism, Sags usually find it easy to feel happy,
              enthusiastic, and to see the bright side of life. Rarely succumb to self-doubt and are usually able to propel themselves forward in life believing everything will work out for the best.
              Typically wonderful storytellers and great teachers putting universal messages of truth and inspiration into their lessons. When moved by a cause Sags will express what's in their minds
              and hearts with great zeal and conviction. </p>

            <h2>Negatives</h2>
            <h5>Here's the problem with Sags...</h5>
            <p>Sagittarius will passionately state their opinions or principles in the moment,
              yet reserve the right to always change their mind, stating just as passionately their new views later on.
              Sags are known to be noncommittal when it comes to plans.
              When trying to get a Sagittarius lover to commit to a long-term relationship, people
              need to manage their expectations, as this fire sign loves to live in the moment and can sometimes break the hearts of those they leave behind.</p>

            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>Sagittarius, the ninth sign of the zodiac, Sags are truth-seekers,
              and the best way for them to do this is to hit the road, talk to others and get some answers. At the end of the day,
              what Sagittarius wants most is to know the meaning of life, and to accomplish this while feeling free and easy. </p>

                  <p>Known for being devoted, determined, and observant. Scorpios tend to be receptive and patient,
                    letting others play their cards and show their intentions first to better understand emotional and psychological
                    dynamics of their relationships. They passionately bond themselves, heart and soul, to those they care for. Once they feel they can trust,
                    they are quite loyal to their friends and lovers.

                  <h2>Negatives</h2>
                  <h5>Here's the problem with Scorpios...</h5>
                  <p>Scorpios can become rigid and fixated and obsessed that it can be difficult to adapt to changes.
                    They are receptive and patient but this can lead to being suspicious and slow to trust people.
                    Give themselves heart and soul when seeking love and sexual connection but if this isn't reciprocated
                    they can become needy and obsessive with their lovers.

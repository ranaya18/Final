                  <p>Mental agility, flexibility, and a competent, precise temperament are the key Virgo qualities.
                    These people are meticulous and attentive, and they think clearly, learn rapidly, and find great
                    joy in serving, healing, and bringing order, precision, and pragmatism to their surroundings.</p>

                  <h5>Here's the problem with Virgos...</h5>
                  <p>Virgo's attitude to life has some potential flaws that are founded in their considerable capabilities.
                    This highly functioning mind, while clever and cognitively nimble, may quickly become hyperactive, causing stress, anxiety, and sleeplessness.
                    It's critical for these indigenous to be connected in their bodies, breath, and the present moment since what they imagine
                    might become more real than what is actually happening.</p>

                    themselves to undertakings and relationships that require some tender loving care,
                    mending, and tending in order to restore their health, purity, and natural function.</p>

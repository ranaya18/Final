                  <p>Tauruses are known for being straight-forward and blunt.
                    They will tell you the truth on your face, no matter how harsh it is.
                    The concept of 'Multitasking' doesn't apply to them.Things can turn ugly when you find yourself in an
                    arguement with a Taurian. They are often short-tempered people who can be angered easily so choose your
                    words carefully while talking to them.
